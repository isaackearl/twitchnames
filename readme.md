## Intro ##

This project was completed in 1 day... and was done as part of a one day website challenge I like to do.  I challenged myself to use VueJS and make a site for something I find useful.  I had never used VueJS before and I realize my code isn't the best, however I am pleased with how things turned out in such a short amount of time.  I think I will start using VueJS more often and learn some best practices.

**Technologies used:**

Laravel PHP, VueJS

## ABOUT ##

**Twitch What is this site about?**

Recently it became possible to change your username on twitch.tv. Unfortunately however, for many of us the usernames we wish to use are not available. This site is just a convenient way to get notified if a username you wish to use ever becomes available.

**Will my desired username ever become available?**

I believe it will. Twitch has said that they are releasing old justin.tv names in batches, and that other names will become available if they are not used in a year.

**What do I have to do?**

Simply register with your email, and add a username you'd like to have, and you'll be notified if it ever becomes available!ble!
